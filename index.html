        You awake with no kingdom, no memories, and characters who keep
        recognizing you as a great hero. Play as Link to save the kingdom from
        the clutches of the evil king Ganon. Link awakes in a world he no longer
        remembers so he must adventure and travel around to figure out exactly
        what he needs to do (save the world) and how to do it. This supposed
        hero must explore and defeat villians and monsters along the way.
        Treasure is to be found all around and can be sold or used in a variety
        of ways. With only what you can find (which turns out to be much more
        than you'd expect) you advance through the game in any order you want.
        <br /><br />
        The game can be played in almost any order that the player wants!
        Besides the first level, which is just introductory, the player can
        travel all around and go wherever they want and unlock whatever area
        they want next! Once you reach certain points in the land (towers and
        shrines) you can teleport to the various locations to aid in speedy
        travel!
        <br /><br />
        As you travel across vast fields, through forests, and up mountain
        peaks, you will discover what has become of the kingdom of Hyrule in
        this stunning world. With the ability to paraglide, run, ride horses,
        swim, and climb, you can go just about anywhere you please!
        <br /><br />
        There are hundreds of different puzzles and hundreds of side quests to

        is always something new to do.
